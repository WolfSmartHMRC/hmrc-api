HMRC uses standard
[HTTP status codes](/api-documentation/docs/reference-guide#http-status-codes)
to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general, status codes
in the 2xx range indicate success. Status codes in the 4xx range indicate a
client error, and have a consistently formed JSON response body. Codes in the
5xx range indicate errors on the HMRC server. API-specific errors are shown in
the relevant resource's response detail. See our
[reference guide](/api-documentation/docs/reference-guide#errors)
for more on errors.
