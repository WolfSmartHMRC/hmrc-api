Specific versions are requested by providing an Accept header. When
backwards-incompatible API changes are made, a new version will be released.
Backwards-compatible changes are released in the current version without the
need to change your Accept header.  See our
[reference guide](/api-documentation/docs/reference-guide#versioning)
for more on versioning.
